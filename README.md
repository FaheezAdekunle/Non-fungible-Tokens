# NFTs [Non-Fungible Tokens]

## What are NFTs?
 NFTs are Non-Fungible Tokens, they are basically another standards just like the ERC20. Thay are denoted as ERC721, and have unique identities. This is where URI is introduced, what are URI's? URI's are universal random Identifiers ad this concept is splitted into two, URL (Universal Random Locator) and URN(Universal Random Name). URI's are unique ID's that differentiate different projects or even a collection of the same project from each other.
